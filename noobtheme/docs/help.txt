= Basetheme =
Basetheme is meant to be the basis for your own theme. It is all black on white with a Zikula logo in the header. You can customize the general layout via Zikula's themes administration and adjust the CSS to you needs.

== Installation ==
You install this theme like any other theme:
 * Upload the folder /basetheme to you /themes directory
 * Refresh the themes list in Zikula's themes administration
 * Enable this theme

== Settings ==
Basetheme enables you to choose some basic settings via Zikula's theme administration. Click the red edit button in the themes list and switch over to "variables". There you see the settings:
 * Page width can be set to 750px, 950px, 974px and 100%
 * You can enable a navigation column and set it left or right
 * You can choose the width of this column: 160px, 180px or 300px

== Blocks ==
If you set the navigation column to left you have to have a blockposition "left" which must be called "right" if you set the column right.

== CSS ==
There is a basic CSS file in /themes/basetheme/style/style.css which you can use to adjust the look of you site. The YUI Grids reset all formatting by the browser so that all text has the same look - no matter if it's h1, p or blockquote. So you can do with it whatever you like.

The current CSS contains border definitions for header, footer, main area and navigation. You can remove them - they are only there to show you where you find stuff ;-)

== Logo ==
You have to change the logo! The Zikula logo is a registered trademark and only placed there as an example.
